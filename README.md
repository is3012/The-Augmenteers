# Suicide Rate Analysis Using Machine Learning Algorithm
Before executing the notebook in your device change the path to the directory where the dataset is present.
Dataset is been uploaded in the repository. We first imported some of the libraries that are useful for our project such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and many other.
We have used Suicides Rates Overview 1985-2014 dataset in our project.
We imported the dataset using read_csv() function.
While understanding the dataset, we observed that our dataset contained 12 attributes/columns and there are 27,820 rows.
This Dataset contains a combination of numerical and categorical features.</br>
